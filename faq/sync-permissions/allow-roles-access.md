# How to give my team access to all channels?

## Set permission in category

2. All permissions you set in the category for roles will be applied and synced to temporary channels. Allow `View Channels` and `Connect` permission to allow that role to join temporary channels.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Permissions for @everyone**

You cannot sync `Connect`, `View Channel` and `Send Message` permissions for `@everyone`, because these permissions are managed when using [/voice privacy](../../commands/voice/privacy.md)!

If your Discord server has a verification system and you want to prevent @everyone from using temporary channels, read [How to integrate my verification system?](../member-roles.md)
{% endhint %}
