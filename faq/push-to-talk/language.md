## Missing your language?

All translation files are publicly available on GitHub. Feel free to add a new language or improve an existing one, as long as you are a native speaker and not using an online translator.

* Fork the translation repo and make your changes.\
  [https://github.com/TempVoice/Translation](https://github.com/TempVoice/Translation)
* Open a **pull request** and wait for your changes to be approved.

If you are not familiar with GitHub forks, download the files, edit them with any editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), and send them back to @excordo at [https://discord.gg/tempvoice](https://discord.gg/tempvoice).
