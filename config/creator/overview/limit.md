{% hint style="info" %}
Users can adjust this setting for their temporary channel by using the [`/voice limit`](../../../commands/voice/limit.md) command or [`interface`](../../../commands/interface.md).

To enforce default settings, disable the limit [command](../features/restore.md) or the [restore](../features/restore.md) setting.
{% endhint %}

The owner of a temporary channel will only be able to set a user limit that is within the range that you have selected.
