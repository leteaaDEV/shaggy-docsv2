Users will still be able to change these properties using [`/voice name`](../../../commands/voice/name.md), [`/voice limit`](../../../commands/voice/limit.md) and [`/voice privacy`](../../../commands/voice/privacy.md), but these settings will not be saved, and creating a new temporary channel will use the default configuration of the creator channel.
