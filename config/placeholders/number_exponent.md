description: Replaced by the last number of temporary channels written as exponent.

# {NUMBER\_EXPONENT}

## Example

```
ðŸ¦”ãƒ»Voice Channel {NUMBER_EXPONENT}
```

How multiple temporary channels from a creator could look like:

```
ðŸ¦”ãƒ»Voice Channel Â¹
ðŸ¦”ãƒ»Voice Channel Â²
ðŸ¦”ãƒ»Voice Channel Â³
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Temporary channels cannot be ordered as shown in this example.

If temporary channel (2) is deleted, the next created temporary channel will take its place and be assigned the number (2). This ensures that the channels remain efficiently utilized, even if they are not in a sequential order.
{% endhint %}
